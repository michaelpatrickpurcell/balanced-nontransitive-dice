# Balanced Non-Transitive Dice
Finding balanced sets of non-transitive dice using a SAT solver.

## Dependencies
This project relies heavily on the Python module `pysat` and its optional dependencies `pblib` and `aiger`.
The simplest way to get and start using `pysat` is to install the latest stable release of the toolkit from PyPI:
```
$ pip install python-sat[pblib, aiger]
```
